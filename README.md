Welcome to the home of **APRS&nbsp;434**,
the 434&nbsp;MHz LoRa APRS amateur radio project that **extends range by saving bytes.**

Unlike some other ham radio LoRa APRS projects,
this [white paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_paper) and project aims at **deploying LoRa the way it was intended;**
namely by being frugal about the number of bytes put on air.
Doing so, reaps a number of benefits:

- less airtime,
- increased battery life,
- higher chances of good packet reception,
- hence, increased range,
- lower probability of packet collisions,
- therefore, more channel capacity.

The documentation of this project was moved to <https://aprs434.readthedocs.io/>
