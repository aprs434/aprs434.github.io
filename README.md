## APRS434

Welcome to the home of APRS434, the 434 MHz LoRa APRS amateur radio project that **extends range by saving bytes.**

Unlike other ham radio LoRa APRS projects, this project aims at **deploying LoRa the way it was intended;** namely by being frugal about the number of bytes put on air. Doing so, reaps a number of benefits:

- Increased battery life,
- Higher chances of good packet reception,
- Hence, increased range,
- Lower probability of packet collisions,
- Therefore, more channel capacity.

LoRa permits sending any of the [128 ASCII characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Character_set).

Stay put for TTGO T-Beam and iGate firmware that will soon be freely available here for downloading.
